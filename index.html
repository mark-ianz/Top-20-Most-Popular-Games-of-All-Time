                                In the simplest of descriptions, Duck Hunt is a
                                game where players use their controllers to
                                shoot ducks that appear on the screen and are
                                rewarded with points. If the player shoots all
                                the required ducks in one level, they can
                                advance to the next level. If their aim is off
                                and they miss one, they&#8217;re staying put
                                until they get them all.
